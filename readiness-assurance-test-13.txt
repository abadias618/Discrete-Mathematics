* TODO Answer a Language/Grammar Question
  What is the language generated by the phrase-structure grammar with
  productions S → SA, S → 0, A → 1A, A → 1, where S is the start symbol?

  - [ ] The set of all strings that consist of a 0 followed by an arbitrary
    number of 1\rsquo{}s (possibly none).
  - [ ] The set of all strings that consist of a 1 followed by an arbitrary
    number of 0\rsquo{}s (possibly none).
  - [ ] The set of all strings consisting of an odd number of 1\rsquo{}s and no other
    symbols.
  - [ ] The set of all strings consisting of an even number of 1\rsquo{}s and no other
    symbols.

* TODO Answer a Grammar/Language Question
  What is a grammar that generates the language {0^{2n}1^n \vbar n \ge 0}?

  - [ ] S → 010S, S → \lambda
  - [ ] S → 00S1, S → \lambda
  - [ ] S → 00S, S → 11S, S → \lambda
  - [ ] S → 1S, S → 0S, S → \lambda
