* Example of Using Dot
#+begin_src dot :file graph1.png
  graph {
    size="4,2"
    bgcolor=transparent
    node [shape=circle fontname=Monospace]
    1 -- 2
    1 -- 3
    3 -- 4
    2 -- 4
    {rank=same 1 3}
    {rank=same 2 4}
  }
#+end_src
* TODO Answer Three Graph Questions
** 1
   Draw the graph whose nodes are a subset of the integers, and whose relation
   is the extension of the predicate:

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun p1 (x y)
    (and (< (abs x) 20)
         (< (abs y) 20)
         (= 1 (+ (* 5 x) (* 7 y)))))
#+end_src

   Use the dot language to draw this graph. Type in a dot-command source block
   like the example shown. Make all your links either horizontal or vertical.

#+begin_src dot :file graph1.png

#+end_src
  graph {
** 2
   Draw the graph whose nodes are the twelve divisors of 72, and whose relation
   is the extension of the predicate:

#+begin_src elisp :results silent
  (defun p2 (x y)
    (or (= y (* 2 x)) (= y (* 3 x))))
#+end_src

   Use the dot language to draw this graph. Type in a dot-command source block
   like the example shown. Make all your links either horizontal or vertical.

** 3
   Draw the graph whose nodes are the twelve divisors of one other number, which
   you must discover, and whose relation is the extension of the same =p2=
   predicate, and whose shape/structure is the same as the 72-divisors graph.

   Use the dot language to draw this graph. Type in a dot-command source block
   like the example shown. Make all your links either horizontal or vertical.
