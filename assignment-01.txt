  This is the first of many exercises/problems/puzzles to come, always displayed
  in this type of yellow-background box.

  Propose a connection between discrete mathematics and the image below.
  (This is a \ldquo{}free association\rdquo exercise --- there is no \ldquo{}right\rdquo answer.)

#+ATTR_HTML: :alt Desert :title What is the meaning of this?!
  [[https://rickneff.github.io/img/desert.jpg]]
#+begin_info
  I think that the Desert image connects with discrete math because both are made of many particles and parts,
  also things in the desert like sand grains and the waves of the sand mountains can be represented by mathematical equations.

  Let $n / 0$ be infinity, for any positive integer /n/.

  What English word has the largest /finite/ consonant-vowel-ratio (CVR)? For
  example, the CVRs of the words (including the TLA) in the previous sentence
  are 3:1, 5:2, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 5:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, and infinity (3:0).

  In the figure below, the innermost circle has radius 1. It is circumscribed by
  an equilateral triangle, which is circumscribed by a circle, which is
  circumscribed by a square, which is circumscribed by yet another circle, and
  so forth.

  What is the radius of the outermost circle?

  It is the (initial radius 1) + (height of the triangle minus previos radius 1) +
  (height of square - previous radius) + (height of the pentagon - previous radius)+...

  R=r1+(h1-r1)+(h2-(h1-r1))+(h3-(h2-(h1-r1)))+(h4-(h3-(h2-(h1-r1)))).....

* Puzzles

#+begin_note
  Pick a number (a positive integer). Form the product of that number, one more
  than that number, and one more than twice that number. Repeat for several
  different numbers. There is a pattern to these products. What is it?
#+end_note
*** Rephrase
*** Approach
    1->P=2*3=6
    2->P=3*5=15   15-6 =  9
    3->P=4*7=28   28-15=  13
    4->P=5*9=45   45-28=  17
    5->P=6*11=66  66-45=  21
    6->P=7*13=91  91-66=  24
    7->P=8*15=120 120-91= 27
*** Solution
    I would say that the pattern is that the difference between each product
    to the previous one in order has a difference of a prime number that increases by 4 as you go up.
*** Proof

   Numbers and words. Cycles and patterns.

   Do you think mathematicians discover or invent patterns? While pondering that
   question, consider what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] famously wrote: /A mathematician, like a
   painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent/
   /than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas/. What do you think he
   meant by that?

   Here\rsquo{}s a puzzle superficially just involving a 6-digit number and a 6-letter
   \ldquo{}word\rdquo. What does
