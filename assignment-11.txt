** HST
#+begin_note
  How does allowing cycles imply the existence of more than one path from one
  graph node to another?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  According to VWC: " The difference is that graphs allow cycles, a path from a
  node back to itself, which also implies the existence of more than one path
  from one node to another (recall that trees have exactly one). In this way
  graphs generalize trees analogous to the way relations generalize functions. "

#+begin_note
  Which node in the [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#outline-container-org53bfa2d][directed graph in VWF]] (figure 62) represents Abu in the
  ping-pong tournament he was in?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  -Abu won as many games as he lost.
  -Winner was the one with the most arrows pointing away.
  ANSWER: Node "D" since it was 3 arrows going out to other nodes, and 3 arrows pointing at him.

  Do some research and figure out where graphs are used in your major, and describe
  how a knowledge of graph theory can be beneficial to you in the future.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  The traveling salesman problem is one that shows the application of graphs in
  some of its implementations and in various aspects of Software Engineering.
  For example the most obvious application "Vehicle Routing".

  What is the degree sequence of a *perfect*, full, complete, level-3 binary tree?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  The degree sequence would be:
  (3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2)
  Given that each node that is not the roor has 1 connection to the parent and 2
  to the child nodes, which means 3 connections per node. The number 2 is the root.

#+begin_note
  Choose a link in the directed tournament graph (figure 62 in HTC). Use all of
  the /directed adjacency/ vocabulary to describe it.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  CHOOSE NODE "A"
  -B,C,D,E,F,G are adjacent from A.
  -A is adjacent to B,C,D,E,F,G.
  -at least one link (k_1 to k_6) from B,C,D,E,F,G comes from A.
  -the 6 links from A go to B,C,D,E,F,G.
  -the links k_1 to k_6 connect A with B,C,D,E,F,G.
  -the links k_1 to k_6 go from A to B,C,D,E,F,G.
  -A is the initial node of k_1 to k_6.
  -B,C,D,E,F,G are terminal nodes of k_1 to k_6.

  What can you say about /K_0/?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  Contemplating the formula the result would be 1/2 or -1/2 , this
  would indicate that there are no nodes, since there cannot exist
  half a node.
  I found some varied opinions and discussions regarding this point.
  However the importanat concept that I learned from it is:
  "Yes, there is such a thing. A graph with zero nodes is generally
  referred to as the null graph. The term empty graph usually refers
  to a graph with no edges (but possibly some nodes)."

  What is the degree sequence of the wheel graph W_5? What is it in general for a
  W_n?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  -The degree sequence is (5,3,3,3,3,3)
  -The general formula would be for W_n (N,N_times 3).

** TODO KDB *
#+begin_note
  List in lisp form all the simple paths (in both representations) from =MT= to
  =NM=, identifying the shortest path(s) and the longest path(s).

** TODO ABR *
#+begin_note
  Directed graphs (/digraphs/ for short) can represent binary relations. Make a
  connection between the four relation types and the existence or non-existence
  of certain features in the graph of the relation.

  - Reflexive = /every/ node has a link that is a loop.
  - Symmetric = there are /no/ single link arrows (one-way trips) --- every link
    arrow is a double one (roundtrip).
  - Antisymmetric = there is /no/ double arrow (going both ways) /unless/ it is
    a loop.
  - Transitive = there is /no/ two-leg journey (think flight with a layover)
    without a shortcut (non-stop flight).

  It is helpful to draw a graph of a relation that is described more abstractly.
  For an example of an abstract description, here is the relation on the set [1
  2 3] given by this vector of \ldquo{}conses\rdquo (another way to say /dotted pairs/)
  representing the ordered pairs:

  [(1 . 1) (1 . 2) (2 . 2) (3 . 3)]

  The three-node four-link graph of that relation appears in [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#outline-container-org53bfa2d][section VWF]].

  Identify which features listed above this graph has. Draw the digraphs of some
  other abstract binary relations, with and without the four features.

#+begin_note
  In another multigraph example, what is the connection between [the \ldquo{}four nodes
  seven links\rdquo] graph and the \ldquo{}birth of graph theory\rdquo?

  What do its nodes and links represent? What is its degree sequence?

  Explore the graph property \ldquo{}Eulerian\rdquo. Does this graph have it? Describe
  necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Eulerian.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  -The connection represents the 7 bridges and 4 pieces of land in KÃ¶nigsberg
  that were connected in the "birth of graph theory" section.
  -The degree sequence is (5,3,3,3)
  -Eulerian Property: A graph is Eulerian if and only if each vertex has an even degree.
  The vertices in the Konigsberg graph have all odd degrees, so we can conclude that:
  The Graph is not Eulerian.
#+end_info
** KEO
#+begin_note
  Explore the question: Does a graph\rsquo{}s degree sequence alone contain enough
  information to reconstruct the graph?
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  Yes, however the reconstruction might be ambiguos.
  meaning that we could build two or more different graphs
  with the same degree sequence.

#+begin_note
  Is there (can there exist) a simple graph with degree sequence =[3 2 1 0]=?
  Justify your answer.
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  No, according to the handshake theorem the sum of [3 2 1 0]
  which is 6 would only allow 3 links to be in the graph which is impossible.
